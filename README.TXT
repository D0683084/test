NCS - CMYK translation table
For your service we have included approximate CMYK values 
for all of the 1 750 NCS standard colours as a text table. 
This table can be used to find the corresponding CMYK value 
for a specific NCS colour for use in software not yet supported 
by an NCS Palette library. These CMYK values are exactly 
the same as those found in the NCS Palette libraries. 
The CMYK values are meant for offset printing on 
matt-coated paper. This table can be found on this CD 
in the Adobe Acrobat file named "NCS CMYK.pdf".  


NCS - RGB translation table now also includes HTML hexadecimal values
This table can be used to find the corresponding RGB value 
for a specific NCS colour for use with software that don't 
support CMYK values and with software not yet supported by 
an NCS Palette library. We recommend you to use CMYK values 
when possible since the resulting colour on screen or in print 
often will deviate from the standard NCS colour sample when 
using RGB. The resulting colour depends on the actual screen, 
printer and software drivers used. This table can be found on 
this CD in the Adobe Acrobat file named "NCS-RGB-HTML.pdf".
The RGB and HTML hex codes in NCS Palette 
is calculated with the following method:
CIELAB values for the NCS primary standards ware used.
They were measured in a Macbeth ColorEye 7000 spectrophotometer 
and evaluated with CIE 10 degree standard observer and CIE standard 
illuminate D65.
From the CIELAB values the RGB values were calculated. 
The calculations were based on trichromatic coordinates, gamma values 
and maximal luminance for Sony trinitron screens. Visual adjustments for 
these values has been made to reach approximately the same hue for all 
colours in every colour triangle and to use the total colour gamut of the 
screen. HTML hexadecimal values can be used to find corresponding 
hexa value for a specific NCS colour for use in HTML applications (web).


NCS web safe colours
Includes the nearest NCS standard colours to the 216 websafe 
HTML colours.
